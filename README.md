# SiIvaGunner Rips Featuring Playlists

A Google Script project that creates and manages YouTube playlists based on corresponding category items retrieved from the SiIvaGunner wiki.

The script checks the list of currently existing playlists and compares it to the list of “Rips Featuring...” categories. If any categories are missing, the script creates a new playlist for that category and adds it to the list of existing playlists. Each playlist is checked one by one to compare the list of videos currently in the playlist to the videos in the corresponding category to identify which videos should be added or removed from the playlist.
